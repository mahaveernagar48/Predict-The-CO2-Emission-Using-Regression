# Predict-The-CO2-Emission-Using-Regression
* Main objective of this project is to Predict the CO2 Emission based on some attributes
* Supervised Algorithm is used to predict the Outcome

## Understanding the Data

### `FuelConsumptionCo2.csv`:

**`FuelConsumptionCo2.csv`**, which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

*   **MODELYEAR** e.g. 2014
*   **MAKE** e.g. Volvo
*   **MODEL** e.g. MDX 4WD
*   **VEHICLE CLASS** e.g. SUV
*   **ENGINE SIZE** e.g. 4.7
*   **CYLINDERS** e.g 6
*   **TRANSMISSION** e.g. A6
*   **FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km)** e.g. 9.9
*   **FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km)** e.g. 8.9
*   **FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km)** e.g. 9.2
*   **CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km)** e.g. 182

## Steps involved in the whole project

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Feature Selection based on correaltion and heatmap
3. Train and Test Split of entire data to trained the data. Model is trained and tested on two different data sets which are mutually exclusive in nature.
4. Simple Linear Regression is used to determine the affect of individual feature on CO2 emission.
    **Engine Size vs CO2 Emission
    **Fuel Consumption vs CO2 Emission
    **Cylinders vs CO2 Emission
